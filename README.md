The goal is to have one spot to get all the information we need to stay up to date with Python. Discover what is out there before anyone else!

#### Work in Progress

Feel free to raise issues, make pull requests(!) or leave feedback. My apologies for the lack of documentation, it will come; eventually.

#### Do It Yourself

Poke me to update it, but generally you should have `elasticsearch` up, run panel.py to gather data and then host with `python main.py`. Site is then available on http://localhost:80
